            <h1>What are mechanical keyboards?</h1>

            <p>Mechanical keyboards are a type of computer keyboard that offers a unique and tactile typing experience. Unlike
                traditional rubber dome keyboards, mechanical keyboards use individual mechanical switches for each key. These
                switches are characterized by their distinct feedback and audible click sound when pressed. This design
                results in a more precise and satisfying typing feel, making mechanical keyboards popular among gamers, typists, and
                programmers. Additionally, mechanical keyboards are known for their durability, as the switches are designed to last
                longer than the rubber domes found in typical keyboards.</p>
